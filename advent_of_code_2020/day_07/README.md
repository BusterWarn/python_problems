# Solution

Both solutions to these problems are similiar. Both use recursive dynamic programming with memoization. While the first solution only counts if a bag can contain a bag, the second solution counts how many bags the *Shiny golden* bag can contain. The second solution is more clean, however it took longer time to figure out even though it is very similar to the first.
