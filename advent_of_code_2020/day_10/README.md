# Solutions

Solution to the first problem is straight forward. Sort the list of adapters, loop through them and count the difference in jolts.

Solution to the second problem could be brute forced. However my simple solution is easier to implement and runs in linear time. Just loop through the list backwards. Add the possible number of adapters to a separate list, and keep adding the possible combinations. It is really simple and runs in linear time.
